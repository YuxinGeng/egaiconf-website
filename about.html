        <h2>About EGAI 2025</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the International Conference on Evolutionary Game and Artificial Intelligence (EGAI 2025). This conference serves as a leading international platform for researchers, academics, and industry professionals to exchange knowledge, share cutting-edge research findings, and explore the latest advancements in the fields of evolutionary game theory and artificial intelligence.</p>

        <h3>History and Goals</h3>
        <p>EGAI was established in [Year] with the goal of bridging the gap between theoretical concepts in evolutionary game theory and their practical applications in artificial intelligence. The conference promotes interdisciplinary collaborations and addresses emerging challenges in areas such as multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, game theory in AI, and bio-inspired computation.</p>

        <h3>Topics of Interest</h3>
        <p>The conference welcomes submissions on a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
